# SRS-Merino #
This project is about understanding the SRS Merino sheep breed. The SRS Merino is a new strain of Merino sheep developed over the past 20 years using sheep classing methods established by Dr Jim Watts. The SRS Merino is particularly interesting as an object of research because it differs from all other Merino sheep in a number of important characteristics related to wool quality.


## Follicle depth and curvature ##
This  subdirectory contains an analysis of differences between wrinkled and loose skinned sheep in follicle size and follicle curvature. Follicle size is characterized as follicle depth, follicle straight length, and follicle curved length. Follicle curvature is calculated as radius of curvature from measurement of follicle straight length and height of arc.
