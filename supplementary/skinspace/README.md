# SRS-Merino #
This project is about understanding the SRS Merino sheep breed. The SRS Merino is a new strain of Merino sheep developed over the past 20 years using sheep classing methods established by Dr Jim Watts. The SRS Merino is particularly interesting as an object of research because it differs from all other Merino sheep in a number of important characteristics related to wool quality.
