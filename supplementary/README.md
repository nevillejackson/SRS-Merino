# SRS-Merino #
This project is about understanding the SRS Merino sheep breed. The SRS Merino is a new strain of Merino sheep developed over the past 20 years using sheep classing methods established by Dr Jim Watts. The SRS Merino is particularly interesting as an object of research because it differs from all other Merino sheep in a number of important characteristics related to wool quality.


## Collagen study material ##
The _collagen_ subdirectory contains a study of the role of soft and hard collagen in the dermis in wrinkle formation, follicle development and fibre growth.

## Review of wrinkle genetics ##
The _wrinkle_ subdirectory contains a pointer to a review of genetics of skin wrinkle. This material is actually located in the _Fleece-genetics_ repository.

## Skinspace study ##
The _skinspace_ subdirectory contains a pointer to a study which explores the idea that secondary follicle development at 100 days is responsible for the excessive expansion of the area of the dermal layer of skin tissue which is one of the prerequisites for wrinkle or fold development.

## Follicle depth and curvature ##
The _depthandcurv_ subdirectory contains an analysis of differences between wrinkled and loose skinned sheep in follicle size and follicle curvature. Follicle size is characterized as follicle depth, follicle straight length, and follicle curved length. Follicle curvature is calculated as radius of curvature from measurement of follicle straight length and height of arc.
