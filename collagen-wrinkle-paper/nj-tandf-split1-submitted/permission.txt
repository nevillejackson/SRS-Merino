Hi Neville,

 

Yes I am the same “Peter Sommerville” who used to work for AWTA Ltd. I am now retired too, but still have contact with AWTA Ltd as Secretary of the Australian Wool Education Trust (www.Woolwise.com).

 

The on-line archive of Wool Technology and Sheep Breeding and its later version International Journal of Sheep and Wool Science was created by the last editor of the Journal, Professor David Cottle. He too has now retired, and last year ceded the management of the archive to the Trust. David had set up the archive as pay for use. The Trust removed that caveat and opened up the archive for free use by registered users. In a few months we will make the entire archive open source so that libraries and other on-line systems can index the contents.

 

The journal is no longer being published.

 

I thought I had redirected the address archivemanager@sheepjournal.net but obviously not so I will address that.

 

You have permission to use the requested figure. Unfortunately I don’t have access to the master copy. However, I may be able to arrange for a new scan of the image from a printed copy of the volume if you wish. AWTA Ltd has a complete set.

 

Good to hear from you,

Hi,

I sent the forwarded message some time ago to archivemanager@sheepjournal.net

I have no reply.  I assume Peter Sommerville is retired or on leave or some such thing.

Do you think you could find someone to deal with this simple request for permission to use a Figure from Wool Technology and Sheep Breeding Journal.

As explained in the forwarded message it is quite important that I obtain permission. I cannot submit our paper without it.

Thank you

Regards

Neville Jackson

Hello Peter,

  Are you the same Peter Sommerville who used to be at AWTA?. I was at CSIRO Prospect, in the Wool Lab.

  I am finishing a paper for my deceased colleague Jim Watts. I need your help with permission to use a figure from the article

Mitchell, T.W. et al (1984) Some physical and mechanical properties of sheep akin with a comparison of "thick" and "thin" skins. Wool Technology and Sheep Breeding, Vol XXXII, No IV, 200-206

It is Figure 1 of that article. We plan to use a cropped part of the image highlighting the skin fold and we will re-label the tissue layers for clarity. It is quite important to our paper that we can use this figure to define the skin layers involved in a wrinkle.

  Our paper is titled as follows

\title{Histology of collagen in Merino sheep skin and its association with skin wrinkle formation and follicle curvature }
\author{The late J.E. Watts S. Maleki, P.G. Swan, J. Gordon, and N. Jackson}

Our study shows that fold formation depends on the type of connective tissue (ie collagen) present in the lower dermis. Fold formation also depends on whether the upper dermis and epidermis grow faster than the other lower skin layers and this only happens in Merinos because of the large number of developing secondary follicles. I feel that it is important to get Jim's work published, because it shows that there is a way forward to breed wrinkle-free Merino sheep without losing out on wool production. Important in relation to the mulesing issue too.

  We intend to submit the paper to New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Research. Their publisher is Taylor and Francis. You can find their guidelines here

https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/using-third-party-material-in-your-article/

so you can see the type of permission required.

  I hope you can help us with this request.

  There is one other thing. If you have an original of that figure (eg one submitted with the manuscript) we would appreciate a high quality color scan. The best we can do is a scan from the printed image in the journal.

  I am retired, and we live on the NSW South Coast near Nowra. Yes in the fire zone. It has been like a nuclear winter here. The fires were as close as we would like to us.

  If you need to send paperwork our address is

PO Box 2318

Bomaderry

NSW, 2541
