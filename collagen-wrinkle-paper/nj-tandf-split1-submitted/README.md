# SRS-Merino #
The _nj-pgs-rewrite_ subdirectory contains drafts  of a study of the histology of skin wrinkle in Merino sheep, and in particular the role of amount and type of collagen in wrinkle formation and follicl curvature. This work was being actively pursued by Dr J.E. Watts ( and his colleagues Ms Sanaz Maleki ans Mr Jim Gordon) up to the time Dr Watts passing from this world in January 2019. 

In this subdirectory, a version submitted to N Z J Agric Res has been preserved.The paper was rejected by NZJAR. Referees comments are in refcomment.txt.

## Supplementary material ##
Additional documents containing supporting analyses and reviews of material can be found in the _../../supplementary_ subdirectory.

## Post Watts Rewrite Documents ##
The _nj-tandf-split1-submitted_ subdirectory contains a complete rewrite of the collagen-wrinkle study prepared for submission to N Z J Agric Res.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of how  the SRS Merino differs from other strains of Merino, and how these differences were achieved in a breeding program. 
In particular the wrinkle histology study aims to achieve an understanding of what a skin wrinkle actually is from an histological and developmental point of view.
