# SRS-Merino #
The _nj-pgs-rewrite_ subdirectory contains drafts  of a study of the histology of skin wrinkle in Merino sheep, and in particular the role of amount and type of collagen in wrinkle formation and follicl curvature. This work was being actively pursued by Dr J.E. Watts ( and his colleagues Ms Sanaz Maleki ans Mr Jim Gordon) up to the time Dr Watts passing from this world in January 2019. 

In this subdirectory, an attempt is being made by Dr Paul Swan and Dr Neville Jackson to complete this important work, because it has significant implications for Merino breeding.  The aim is to achieve publication of the basic histological observations on skin wrinkle

## Supplementary material ##
Additional documents containing supporting analyses and reviews of material can be found in the _../../supplementary_ subdirectory.

## Post Watts Rewrite Documents ##
The _nj-pgs-rewrite_ subdirectory contains a complete rewrite of the collagen-wrinkle study with a view to publication of the basic histological observations on skin wrinkles. 
This version includes follicle curvature data and macro measurements on skin specimens.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of how  the SRS Merino differs from other strains of Merino, and how these differences were achieved in a breeding program. 
In particular the wrinkle histology study aims to achieve an understanding of what a skin wrinkle actually is from an histological and developmental point of view.
