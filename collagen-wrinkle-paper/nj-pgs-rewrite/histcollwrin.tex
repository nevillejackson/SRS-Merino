\section{Introduction} 

Wrinkle formation in Australian Merino sheep skin is a phenomenon with serious economic and political consequences.  It has long been known (Seddon, Belschner, and Mulhearn (1931)~\cite{sedd:31}) that wrinkled sheep are more susceptible to blowfly strike. The use of the {\em mulesing} operation to control flystrike in Merino sheep has recently been the subject of intense animal ethics scrutiny. No effective alternative management option has appeared.
The most effective long term solution would seem to be to breed the wrinkle out of Merino sheep. This approach has sometimes met with resistance from some Australian Merino breeders who feel that the extra skin surface area of wrinkled sheep is necessary to achieve high levels of wool production. Breeding plans which include some culling on wrinkle usually do not lead to its complete elimination (for example Turner Dolling and Kennedy (1968)~\cite{turn:68}).

This study  is an attempt to go back to the basic biology of wrinkle formation, to see whether we can understand the tissue structure of a wrinkle, and to see if that suggests  a better approach breeding of wrinkle-free sheep,  without lowering productivity or adversely affecting wool quality. 

There have been very few attempts to define what a wrinkle actually is. The early work of Carter(1943)~\cite{cart:43} went as far as describing and naming all the folds on the neck, body, and breech, and developed a set of photographic scores for degree of wrinkle. Carter used the terms {\em fold} and {\em wrinkle} interchangeably, but he distinguished the small {\em pin wrinkles} present in all Merinos, from the larger folds which develop to varying degrees as the sheep matures. From this early start, there is, somewhat surprisingly, nothing on the biology of wrinkles, until the study of Mitchell et al(1984)~\cite{mitc:84}. 

The Mitchell et al(1984)~\cite{mitc:84} paper defines five tissue layers in sheep skin.
\begin{description}
\item[Layer1] epidermis is mainly keratinised protein
\item[Layer2] contains wool follicles and accessory glands, and is part of the dermis. Sometimes called {\em papillary layer}.
\item[Layer3] layers 2 and 3 together called 'dermis' . Contains fibrous proteins, collagen, and elastin. Sometimes called {\em reticular layer} although the structure is not always reticular, but may be interwoven.
\item[Layer4] contains voluntary muscle, collagen and elastin
\item[Layer5] adipose tissue
\end{description}
 These are illustrated in Figure ~\ref{fig:mitchell}
\input{figmitchell.tex}
Only the first 3 layers curve upward in a folded section of skin, layers 4 and 5 remain straight. This can be seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:mitchell}. Mitchell et al note that Layer2 is much weaker than Layer 3 ( collagen not as hard). When wrinkles or folds occur in the skin, Layers 1,2, and 3 buckle up into a fold, while Layers 4-5 are straight. It appears as if wrinkles are formed either by an overgrowth of Layers 1-3, or by a shrinkage or tightening of Layer 4. Mitchell has demonstrated this by showing that if Layer4 (and Layer 5) are dissected away from a skin specimen with wrinkles, the folds in Layers 1-3 flatten out. So in a wrinkled sheep, Layer 4 is holding the skin under some tension, which relaxes when Layer 4 is removed.

Even less is known about wrinkle development. Merino lambs are born with visible wrinkles.  A somewhat obsure reference (Bogolyubsky (1940)~\cite{bogo:40}) asserts that wrinkles were observed forming in foetal skin of Karakul and Merino lambs at around 100 days of gestation. That is about the time at which the secondary derived follicles initiate. Carter(1943)~\cite{cart:43} presents a photograph of the skin surface of a 10 day old Merino lamb (Plate 13 Figure 1) which clearly shows small {\em pin wrinkles}. There are no other studies of foetal wrinkle development, but there is a considerable literature on follicle development ( see Fraser and Short(1960)~\cite{fras:60} and Maddocks and Jackson(1988)~\cite{madd:88} and Ryder and Stevenson(1968)~\cite{ryde:68} for reviews). There is some literature on collagen development in sheep skin, and we will look at that below.

What is to be investigated in this study is that the amount and type ( and maybe timing and arrangement in the skin) of collagen development might be a factor involved with both wrinkle development and follicle development. So what is known about collagen? Well, it is already present in the dermis (layers 2 and 3) of foetal skin at the time follicles develop (Knight et al (1993) ~\cite{knig:93}). 
 These authors distinguish two collagen types ( Type III or 'soft' collagen, and Type I or 'hard' collagen) and note  that Type III is highest at 75 days of gestation, and falls progressively as the foetus develops, while Type I is low at day 75 and rises to over 50 percent by birth. Collagen fibres are formed from cells called {\em fibroblasts}. At 75-80 days the fibroblasts appear as plump, immature cells surrounded by reticular collagen fibres which are composed of Type III collagen. By birth the fibroblasts have matured  and the collagen fibres may be intermeshed to varying degrees. If the fine reticular fibre pattern remains, it is soft collagen, if the fibres intermesh the collagen tissue is hardened to various degrees. 

Collagen development, secondary follicle development and wrinkle formation  all seem to commence at the same time of around 100 days of foetal age.  Follicle development ceases at around birth ( 150 days) but development of collagen and wrinkles continues into the adult sheep. In this study we look at the end points of development - that is we study collagen and follicles in adult sheep with and without wrinkles. That will not reveal the details of development, but it should make clear any obvious associations between collagen, wrinkles, and follicles.
