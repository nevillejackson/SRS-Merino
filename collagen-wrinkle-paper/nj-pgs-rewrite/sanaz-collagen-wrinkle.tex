{\selectlanguage{english}
\foreignlanguage{english}{Comparative studies of the quantity and type
of dermal collagen, and related follicle and fibre properties, of
Merino sheep visually selected as having either wrinkly skins or loose
and supple (non-wrinkly) skins are reported. }}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{All of the sheep with wrinkly skins had thick,
enmeshed sheets of mainly hard (Type I) collagen fibrils in the
papillary dermis below the follicles and surrounding the follicle
bulbs. This hard collagen layer was thick and continuous throughout the
skin with no difference in collagen content or type measured for
samples collected {\textquotedblleft}on wrinkles{\textquotedblright} or
{\textquotedblleft}between wrinkles {\textquotedblleft}. \ The follicle
groups were \ severely disrupted. The follicles were highly curved,
long and uneven in length. The secondary fibres were high in mean fibre
diameter, and highly variable in fibre diameter and fibre length. \ }}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{Virtually no hard collagen was detected in the
dermises of non-wrinkly sheep with loose and supple skins. The collagen
was mainly soft (Type III) and the fibrils were arranged as reticular
patterns of thin sheets. \ The follicle groups were well-defined and
arranged in orderly, well-spaced rows. \ The sheep had high numbers of
secondary follicles per group, and high follicle densities. The
follicles were straight, short and uniform in length. The primary
fibres and secondary fibres were fine and uniform in diameter and
uniform in length.}}

{\selectlanguage{english}

\foreignlanguage{english}{\textbf{Introduction}}}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{Most Merino sheep have wrinkly skins. \ Wrinkles are
raised and often hardened areas of skin which appear to form when t}he
epidermis, papillary dermis and reticular dermis buckle up into a
fold(Figure 1). }


\bigskip

\foreignlanguage{english}{\textbf{Figure 1. \ \ Merino sheep skin
showing layers. 1. epidermis with wool fibres; 2. papillary layer of
dermis, 3. reticular layer of dermis; 4. areolar tissue and muscle; and
5. adipose tissue. Two wrinkles are present; one alongside each side of
the forceps (from Mitchell et al, 1984).}}}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{Jackson and Watts (2018) proposed that wrinkles form
when a lot of follicles initiate the upper papillary dermis, causing
this layer to expand considerably, and at the same time, a lot of hard
collagen fibrils form in the papillary dermis below the follicle bulbs,
binding the dermis against expansion. The conflict between these two
tensions is thought to cause the epidermis and dermis to fold and a
wrinkle to be formed. }}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{Collagen is the major component of connective tissue
of the skin. It is present in foetal sheep skin at 75 to 80 days; the
time when wool follicles develop (Knight et al 1993). These authors
distinguish two collagen types, namely Type III or {\textquoteleft}soft
collagen{\textquoteright} and Type I or
{\textquoteleft}hard{\textquoteright} collagen. They report that Type
III collagen is highest at 75 days of gestation, and falls
progressively as the foetus develops, while Type I collagen is low at
day 75 and rises to over 50 percent by birth. \ }}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{Collagen fibrils are formed from cells called
fibroblasts. At 75 to 80 days of foetal life, the fibroblasts are
plump, immature cells surrounded by a fine, reticular pattern of
collagen fibrils which are composed of Type III collagen. By birth the
fibroblasts have matured and the collagen fibrils may be enmeshed to
varying degrees. If the fine, reticular pattern of fibrils remains, it
appears to be soft collagen and skin wrinkling does not seem to
develop. If the collagen fibrils enmesh, lengthen and thicken, the
collagen tissue appears to be hardened. }}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{Wool follicles also derive from fibroblasts that have
transformed into prepapilla cells in the foetal skin (Moore et al,
1989; Moore et al, 1998). Primary follicles initiate first,
}\textcolor{black}{from about 65 days of gestation and secondary
original follicles follow at 85 days; both as downgrowths of epidermal
tissue into the dermis at pre-determined initiation sites. Secondary
derived follicles initiate at 110 days until shortly after the birth of
the lamb at 145 days as branches of secondary original follicles. Moore
et al (1989, 1998) propose that wool follicle patterning is determined
by the number and distribution of prepapilla cells.}}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{Bogolyubsky (1940) observed that wrinkles appear in
the foetal skin of Merino and Karakul lambs at about 100 days of
gestation; first on the dorsal surface and then extending down the
sides to the belly. This time frame coincides with the period when
secondary derived follicles initiate. Developing wool follicles that
encounter hard collagen sheets in the dermis, may grow in a curved
shape and the arrangement and shape of follicle groups may be
distorted. Nay (1966) recognised that Merino sheep with tangled or
curved follicles have more distortion of the follicle groups and a
poorly organised network of skin blood vessels compared with sheep with
straight follicles (Nay 1966). The genetic correlation of wrinkle score
with follicle curvature is very high (0.69 with 95 percent confidence
limits 0.65-0.74) (Jackson 2017) which suggests, but does not prove,
that collagen is the linking factor. }}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
Curved follicles grow curved fibres, with a greater proportion of
paracortex, and a more highly keratinised \textcolor{black}{paracortex.
The rate and type of fibre growth is a question of the way the bulb
cells differentiate to form the fibre cortex in straight versus curved
follicles. In curved follicles there is more bilateral asymmetry in the
fibre cortex (Mercer, 1950). If there is more keratinisation }it means
bulb cell differentiation into fibre proceeds for longer, so the fibre
length growth rate would be slower. }

{\selectlanguage{english}
If Jackson and Watts{\textquoteright} \ hypothesis is correct, we expect
to see:}

\end{itemize}

\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
Merino sheep with loose and supple skins are free of skin wrinkle.
Histologically, the follicle patterning consists of well-spaced,
orderly rows of compact follicle groups with high secondary follicle to
primary follicle (S/P) ratio and high follicle density. The follicles
are straight rather than curved, and evenly seated in the skin. \ The
wool fibres are uniformly long and highly aligned. The primary fibres
and secondary fibres are fine and uniform in diameter (reference). The
loose and supple skin sheep, like the wrinkly skin sheep, can be
identified subjectively with considerable accuracy, and have been used
in \ these studies as the control group to investigate
whether\foreignlanguage{english}{ collagen quantity and type are
involved in wrinkle formation and follicle and fibre development. }}

\textbf{Discussion~}}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{Wrinkly skin sheep, compared with loose and supple
skin sheep, have more collagen in the papillary dermis. The collagen is
mainly hard (type I) collagen. The follicles are highly curved, long
and unevenly seated. There are fewer secondary follicles per follicle
group. \ The follicle density is lower. The follicle groups are
arranged in closely packed and disorderly rows. The sheep grow
secondary fibres of a higher \ and more variable diameter and a shorter
and more variable length, compared with loose and supple skin sheep.
The fibres are more irregular in shape and orientation and display a
bilateral asymmetry of orthocortex and paracortex (measurements on
orthocortex and paracortex yet to be done). The fleece fibres are
entangled and the fleece consists of much thicker staples. }}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{These findings are consistent with Jackson and Watts
(2018) hypothesis that wrinkle form when a lot of follicles initiate
they expand the upper papillary dermis considerably whilst the
papillary dermis below the follicle bulbs contracts due to the presence
of high amounts of hard collagen. The conflict between these two
tensions causes the epidermis and dermis to fold, just like a bimetal
strip bending. Only sheep with both a high follicle number and a high
collagen develop wrinkle. The genes for follicle number interact with
the genes for collagen development. This is an epistatic effect - two
sets of genes interacting. Epistatic variance of wrinkle score can be
detected in analyses of quantitative variation of wrinkle scores
(Jackson and Watts, 2018). It accounts for approximately 25 percent of
phenotypic variation in wrinkle score (Jackson and Watts (2018)). These
analyses of quantitative variation support our two component or
{\textquotedblleft}folding{\textquotedblright} hypothesis for wrinkle
formation.}}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{However, it is the general hardening of collagen in
the papillary dermis below the follicles, and not wrinkle per se, that
interferes with wool follicle development. So, it is expected that
sheep can be plain bodied (wrinkle free) and still have hard collagen
and impaired follicle development. If the skin is not supple and
compressible, hard collagen is likely to be present. If the skin has
limited dermal expansion because of low follicle numbers, wrinkles are
unlikely to develop. This is what would seem to happen in Downs Wool
breeds of sheep.}}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{The reticular dermis (layer 3) of all sheep in this
study remained supple and low in collagen content, and was not directly
involved in wrinkle formation. However, this layer is usually retained
at the base of the wrinkle (see Figure 1). It is possible that as
wrinkly sheep age, or more extreme cases of wrinkly sheep are studied,
that hard collagen deposition in the reticular dermis may be found. }}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{We suggest that three developmental processes may be
involved in differentiating wrinkly skin from loose and supple skin.
Firstly, there may be a {\textquotedblleft}trade
off{\textquotedblright} process whereby certain foetal fibroblasts are
committed to differentiate into prepapilla cells and wool follicles,
whereas the remaining fibroblasts are committed to producing collagen
and perhaps collagen of a specific type (eg. type I or type III).
\ Secondly, }\textcolor{black}{there may be an
{\textquotedblleft}interference{\textquotedblright} process where hard
collagen laid down in the foetal skin can impair secondary follicle
initiation, maturation and fibre growth. Thirdly, there may be a
{\textquotedblleft}folding{\textquotedblright} process where the high
dermal expansion accompanying high follicle initiation and excessive
deposition of hard collagen in the underlying dermis create opposing
tensions for skin wrinkle to develop. }}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{We know something about the development process of the
loose and supple skin sheep used in these studies. The pre-papilla cell
model of Moore et al (1989) and Moore et al (1998) shows that some of
the foetal fibroblasts transform into pre-papilla cells. The
pre-papilla cells are then directed to aggregate as small
{\textquotedblleft}packages{\textquotedblright} to form many wool
follicles that produce fine wool fibres of uniform diameter. This model
explains why suppression of the size of primary follicles (and
therefore suppression of primary fibre diameter), leads to \ greater
numbers of secondary derived follicles (higher S/P ratio) being formed.
In the loose and supple skin sheep, the fibroblasts that do not
transform into pre-papilla cells, appear to be programmed to produce
soft (type III ) collagen rather than hard (type I) collagen. This is
what we refer to as the {\textquotedblleft}trade
off{\textquotedblright} hypothesis. }\textcolor{black}{Fibroblasts are
common to collagen fibril formation and prepapilla cell formation which
sets the stage for a possible
{\textquotedblleft}tradeoff{\textquotedblright} between collagen and
follicles. }\textcolor{black}{The distinctly better suppleness scores
and compressibility measurements for loose and supple skin sheep
compared to wrinkly skin sheep suggest this is the case.}}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{The reticular dermis (layer 3) of all sheep in this
study remained supple and low in collagen content, and was not directly
involved in wrinkle formation. However, this layer is usually retained
at the base of the wrinkle (see Figure 1). It is possible that as
wrinkly sheep age, or more extreme cases of wrinkly sheep are studied,
that hard collagen deposition in the reticular dermis may be found. }}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{Mitchell (1984) showed that if layer 4 (and layer 5)
are dissected away from a skin specimen with wrinkles, the folds in
layers 1 to 3 flatten out. In a wrinkly sheep, layer 4 is holding the
skin under some tension, which relaxes when layer 4 is removed.
Nevertheless, the published photograph of Mitchell{\textquoteright}s
dissection (Figure 5) reveals that the wrinkles are not completely
removed. \ }}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{Data shown here (Table 6) indicates that the pattern
of skin wrinkling on the sheep{\textquoteright}s body matches the
developmental pattern set at about day 20 of embryogenesis when 31
segments known as somites develop. }\textcolor{black}{The dorsal
portion of the somite is called a dermomyatome. Over time, the
dermatome disperses to form the dermis, and the myatome, the
musculature. A~}\textcolor{black}{dermatome}\textcolor{black}{~is an
area of skin that is supplied by a single spinal nerve. There are 31
spinal nerves and 31 vertical wrinkle lines to be found in the cervical
to sacral regions of the sheep{\textquoteright}s body. It is suggested
that if wrinkles are going to develop, this is most likely to occur at
the points of least resistance such as the channels housing the spinal
nerves and its major branches. Furthermore, }\textcolor{black}{collagen
development must be in one dimension. If it \ were two dimensional the
upper layers of skin would form a lump, rather than a fold. }}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{There has been a long and often heated debate in the
Merino sheep breeding community about wrinkles or folds in the skin
(Austen,1943). Most breeders have insisted that Merino sheep with skin
wrinkle produce more wool, presumably as a result of having greater
skin surface area for growing wool. However, studies have
}\textcolor{black}{shown that clean fleece weight is similar for both
types whilst the fleece from a wrinkly sheep is less uniform owing to
variations of both the diameter and length of the fibres (Spencer et
al, 1928; Bosman, 1933; Belschner and Carter 1936a, 1936b; Burns, 1936;
Belschner et al,1937; Bell et al, 1937; Medevbekov,1957).
\ Furthermore, it has been clearly demonstrated that skin wrinkle
markedly increased susceptibility to fly strike (Seddon et al, 1931;
Belschner,1937) and reduced reproductive efficiency (Carter and
Belschner,1937; Gill and Graham, 1939, 1940; Dun, 1964; Dun and
Hamilton, 1965; and Drinan and Dun, 1965).}}


\bigskip

{\selectlanguage{english}
\textcolor{black}{The debate was taken up by geneticists in the 1950s
who set about declaring that wrinkle was a component of clean fleece
weight and establishing a scoring method with photographic standards
(Turner et al,1953; Turner, 1956; and Turner, 1958). This decision
needs to be reversed. It may have been averted at the time had a study
of the effect of collagen development on follicle development, as
reported here, been undertaken, or the studies on fly strike
susceptibility of Belschner and fecundity of Dun and colleagues been
considered more carefully. Our view is that there should be a zero
tolerance to skin wrinkle coupled with selection for loose and supple
skin. \ One of the authors (JW) has developed a Merino sheep (referred
to as{\textquotedblright}SRS{\textquotedblright}) with a loose and
supple skin, completely free of skin wrinkle. He asserts that this skin
type is necessary to produce fleeces of high quantity and quality
(Watts et al, 2017), with the sheep being naturally resistant to fly
strike and not requiring to be mulesed (Watts, 2008 a, b; Watts, 2016).
