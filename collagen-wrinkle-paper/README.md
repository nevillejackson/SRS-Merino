# SRS-Merino #
The _collagen-wrinkle-paper_ subdirectory contains draft writeups of a study of the histology of skin wrinkle in Merino sheep, and in particular the role of amount and type of collagen in wrinkle formation. This work was being actively pursued by Dr J.E. Watts ( and his colleagues Ms Sanaz Maleki ans Mr Jim Gordon) up to the time Dr Watts passing from this world in January 2019. 
An attempt is being made by Dr Paul Swan and Dr Nevile Jackson to complete this important work, because it has important implications for Merino breeding.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of how  the SRS Merino differs from other strains of Merino, and how these differences were achieved in a breeding program. 
In particular the wrinkle histology study aims to achieve an understanding of what a skin wrinkle actually is from an histological and developmental point of view.
