# SRS-Merino #
This project is about understanding the SRS Merino sheep breed. The SRS Merino is a new strain of Merino sheep developed over the past 20 years using sheep classing methods established by Dr Jim Watts. The SRS Merino is particularly interesting as an object of research because it differs from all other Merino sheep in a number of important characteristics related to wool quality.

## Documents ##
The following documents are either planned or present as _.docx_ files
* Paper_1  - SRS classing standards and photographic standards. 
* Paper_2  - Responses in fleece weight, fibre diameter and wool quality in flocks using SRS classing.
* Paper_3  - Fleece structure phenotypes (SRS, semi-SRS, heavy tight, flat skin), and skin characteristics in Merino stud survey (1986-1995).
* Paper_4  - Changes in fibre density, S/P ratio and fibre length of Merino flocks selected using SRS, clean fleece weight (and fibre diameter), or selected directly for these follicle and fibre traits.
* Paper_5  - On the follicle patterning of fleece rot resistant sheep.
* Paper_6  - Skin wrinkle.

## Supplementary material ##
Additional documents containing supporting analyses and reviews of material can be found in the _supplementary_ subdirectory.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of how  the SRS Merino differs from other strains of Merino, and how these differences were achieved in a breeding program.
